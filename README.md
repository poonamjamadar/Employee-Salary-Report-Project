The Employee Salary Report project is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) initiative performed using NumPy and Pandas libraries. The objective of this project is to analyze employee salary data, identify trends, and extract meaningful insights. The project involves data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploration by handling missing values, renaming columns for consistency, and filtering records based on specific criteria. Through grouping and aggregation, the analysis reveals patterns such as average salary by department, the most common job titles, and salary distribution across various experience levels.The project also includes statistical analysis by calculating mean.
Python: For data processing and analysis.
NumPy: Used for numerical operations and handling arrays.
Pandas: For data manipulation, filtering, and aggregation.
Jupyter Notebook: IDE used for executing the EDA process step by step.
